The Dog Breeds Image Classification project has achieved remarkable success in accurately predicting dog breeds from images. Leveraging machine learning techniques, especially transfer learning, yielded promising outcomes.

Using a dataset sourced from the Kaggle dog breed identification competition, comprising over 10,000 labelled images spanning 120 different dog breeds, I worked on a multi-class image classification task.

Through structured experimentation, I successfully trained a model that demonstrated favorable accuracy. With the potential for further improvement by increasing the training data volume, initial results are encouraging.
